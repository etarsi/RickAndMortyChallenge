# RickAndMortyChallenge

## Objective

You have to request all the `character`, `locations` and `episodes` of https://rickandmortyapi.com/ and indicate:

1. Char counter:
    - how many times the letter **"l"** appears in the names of all the `location`
    - how many times the letter **"e"** appears in the names of all the `episode`
    - how many times the letter **"c"** appears in the names of all the `character`
    - How long did the program take ðŸ‘† in total (from start of execution to delivery of results)

2. Episode locations:
    - for each `episode`, indicate the quantity and a list with the `location` (`origin`) of all the `character` that appeared in that `episode` (without repeating)
    - How long did the program take ðŸ‘† in total (from start of execution to delivery of results)

3. Output in json format with this structure:
```json
